<center> Hi, my name is Hugo Padovani =) </center>

## Who am I?

<img src="/assets/img/about/me.jpg" width="200" height="200">

I'm a data scientist in love with machine learning, astronomy, astrophisics and science in general. 

Currently I'm working on a real estate company, where I get to apply Machine Learning techniques on daily basis to solve super interesting problems.

## Why am I doing this blog?

I've always been in love with science. Every since I was a child I used to ask questions about everything, always curious about how stuff works, and why the universe is what it is. Due to this curious nature of mine, I've jumped into studying science all the way, and became even more in love with it. 

One of the fundamental concepts in science is always to ask questions about the world, to formulate hypothesis and how to correctly test them in order to get a good feeling of what is going on around us. This is called the **scientific method**, a step-by-step way of thinking that scientists follows in order to create knowledge and develop science.

In a nutshell, it works as follows:

* Define a question;
* Gather information and resources (data gathering);
* Form an explanatory hypothesis;
* Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner;
* Analyze the data;
* Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis;
* Repeat process if necessary.

This process is led with rigorous **skepticism** about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. This is something that people are not used to do, given that everybody is biased in almost every subject. People are not making questions about the universe around them, and that is quite sad!

Carl Sagan once said that we live in a society that is heavily dependent on science and technology, where almost nobody knows anything about science and technology. I am here to try to change that!

With that said, I intent to post a series of experiments and tutorials about data science, machine learning and science in general. I hope that you, reader, may have a great time such as the one I'm having by sharing this stuff with you! =)

I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil! I'm passionate about data science, machine learning and astronomy/astrophysics. I graduated in Electrical Engineering from University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where I had the opportunity to study abroad in Australia, Melbourne, on Monash University.
I've always been in love with science. Every since I was a child I used to ask questions about everything, always curious about how stuff works, and why the world is what it is.
